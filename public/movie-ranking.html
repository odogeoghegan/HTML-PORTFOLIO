<h1>The Best Movies Ever</h1>
<h2>My Top 3:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances.</p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>One of the most influential films of the 1990s, Pulp Fiction is a delirious post-modern mix of neo-noir thrills, 
    pitch-black humor, and pop-culture touchstones.</p>
<h3>Hot Fuzz</h3>
<p>The brilliant minds behind Shaun of the Dead successfully take a shot at the buddy cop genre with Hot Fuzz. 
    The result is a bitingly satiric and hugely entertaining parody.</p>
